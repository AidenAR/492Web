    <h1>Reimagining CAPTCHAs – A Continuous Scroll Journey</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Why CAPTCHAs Exist in the First Place</h2>
    <p>CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) were created to protect websites from bots by verifying that the user is a real human. They serve as gatekeepers to prevent spam, abuse, and automated attacks.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Current Types of CAPTCHAs and Their Shortcomings</h2>
    <p>Traditional CAPTCHAs include distorted text recognition, image selection (e.g., traffic lights), and simple puzzles. However, they often frustrate users and can be inaccessible for those with disabilities. Bots are also becoming better at solving them.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Stanford Image Recognition Example</h2>
    <p>Stanford's AI models have shown they can solve image-based CAPTCHAs more accurately than humans, highlighting the limitations of these systems in keeping up with technological advancements.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Paid CAPTCHA Solvers</h2>
    <p>Some services pay humans minimal wages to solve CAPTCHAs, essentially turning them into a mechanical task rather than a security measure. This practice defeats the original purpose of CAPTCHAs entirely.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Professor Interviews and Key Insights</h2>
    <p>Through expert interviews, we learned that CAPTCHAs are often implemented without considering accessibility or user experience. Professors emphasized the need for inclusive design and the importance of transparent data usage policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Theory-Crafted CAPTCHA Alternatives</h2>
    <p>We explored new CAPTCHA models such as gesture-based authentication, behavioral tracking, and user personalization. These alternatives aim to be more user-friendly, but none are without flaws, especially regarding privacy and edge-case handling.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Way Forward: Background Bot Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Considering the glaring accessibility issues of CAPTCHA tests, there needs to be a completely different paradigm for distinguishing 
      bots from humans. Based on our research findings and discussions with experts, the way forward will be methods that 
      operate completely in the background; required user interactions inevitably create potential accessibility issues, insufficient 
      security, or both.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloudflare's Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/application-services/products/turnstile/" target="_blank">Turnstile</a> is one 
      such invisible alternative to interactive CAPTCHA tests. Turnstile is <a href="https://www.dpi.nc.gov/about-dpi/technology-services/digital-accessibility/wcag-21-level-aa" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1 AA</a>
      compliant service that analyzes browser attributes, network signals, and user behaviour. Machine learning algorithms use this information
      to determine the liklihood that the user is a bot; based on this determination, a cryptographic <i>challenge</i> of varying difficulty 
      will be given. This challenge runs in the background, granting a token upon completion. Beyond avoiding accessibility concerns, an 
      advantage of the service is the ability to fine-tune the difficulty of the cryptographic challenge. Common features of site users 
      that previously completed the challenge are tracked, letting Turnstile slow down future bot traffic.
    </p>

    <h3>So, what's the catch?</h3>
    <p>
      Despite the numerous advantages of a service like Turnstile, there has to be a catch, right? Our findings suggest that gains made in 
      accessibility may be traded for greater privacy concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of January 2025, Cloudflare services were being used in <a href="https://backlinko.com/cloudflare-users" target="_blank">24 million</a> 
      active websites across the globe. Zooming into the 10,000 most visited websites worldwide,
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align:center;">over 43% utilize Cloudflare services.</h4>
    <p>
      With such a prolific userbase, Cloudflare has the ability to silently gather data on virtually <i>everyone</i>. In Canada, we have 
      the <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/" target="_blank">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a>
      to protect us from unreasonable and non-consentual data gathering, but data privacy laws are not uniform across the globe. Further, 
      even with data privacy legislation, there is no guarantee that companies like Cloudflare will comply in totality and it can be extrodinarily
      difficult to prove that companies are illicitly gathering or using data away from the public eye.

    <h2>This Website's Built-In Bot Detection</h2>
    <div>
      <h3 id="result" style="text-align:center"></h3>
      <img id="resultImage" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto; border-radius: 30px; display: block;
      margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
          Instead of requiring users to complete a CAPTCHA puzzle to determine if they are human, this website detects bots entirely in the
          background and non-invasively. This website's underlying detection script focuses on analyzing data from the user's browser and 
          scroll behaviour, which can contain common signs of bots that can be detected in real-time.
  
      </p>
      <h3>What are some indicator signs of bots?</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <b>Scroll behaviour analysis.</b> The background script will pick up on how quickly the user begins scrolling through the website
              upon loading the page. Bots can load a web page and begin scrolling nearly instantly: far quicker than any human would be 
              reasonably expected to. For demonstration purposes, if you scroll this page within 300ms of loading it, you will 
              be flagged as a bot (in reality, this threshold would be much lower).
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>The browser's <i>Navigator</i> object. </b> The <i>Navigator</i> object represents the state and identity of the user's
              browser, such as its version, operating system, and capabilities. Some automation tools will set the <i>navigator.webdriver</i>
              property to <i>true</i> as an indication of being controlled by an automated bot.<br> 
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>The <i>Headless</i> indicator. </b> The <i>Headless</i> flag in a browser is a common indication of a user agent that is 
              designed to scrape website data or perform other script-based activities. With these two property checks, most basic bot activity 
              can be detected.
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>Default language. </b> Browsers used by humans almost always have a set default language, which makes it simple for website 
              content to be loaded in the user's preferred language, if available. However, bots typically do not have this property set, 
              providing another indicator of bot activity.
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>The browser's <i>eval</i> function. </b> Since bots can fake user-agent strings that the previous indicators rely on,
              checking deeper properties of JavaScript functions can help detect inconsistencies. This website's script verifies properties 
              like the length of the <i>eval</i> function, which should be consistent for each browser. If a a mismatch is detected, which 
              may occur in headless or modified browsers, it suggests the environment might be automated or tampered with.
          </li>
          <li>
              <b>The <i>Document Object Model</i>.</b> The DOM is a structured representation of a web page that browsers create when loading 
              web pages. The page is organized as a tree of elements to be dynamically interacted with. Some automation tools add specific 
              attributes to the DOM that can reveal bot activity, which this website's script can pick up on.
          </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h3>Try it yourself!</h3>
      <p>
        You can try out the behaviour analysis portion of the bot detection script by refreshing this page and scrolling within 300ms. If 
        you do, the "Bot Detected" message will appear!
      </p>
      <p>
          Alternatively, you can go to <b><a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.browserless.io/debugger/">Browserless Debugger</a></b>,
          which can emulate bot activity with a Headless browser. Replace the code with the following, then click the play button at the top-right. Wait a moment for 
          it to load, then this page will be displayed with a "Bot Detected" message!
      </p>
      <h4>Copy-paste this code:</h4>
      <code>
          export default async ({ page }: { page: Page }) => { await page.goto('https://google.com/'); }
      </code>
      <p><b>***There will be a screenshot here of what it should look like***</b></p>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h3>What are some limitations to this approach?</h3>
      <p>
          Unfortunately, this website's bot detection script isn't perfect. In the grand scheme of bot detection, it has quite a narrow focus, 
          detecting only a few indicators like navigator.webdriver and “Headless” in the user agent, which more advanced bots would be 
          capable of bypassing. It also targets a limited number of tools, letting it work well against certain automation tools, but it may 
          miss bots using other techniques. Further, legitimate variations in browsers can affect detection accuracy. Finally, with the 
          constantly evolving nature of technology, both bots and browsers are always changing; continued efficacy requires consistent 
          adaptations to new automated bot techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
          Further improvements could be made by expanding the scope beyond browser-based analysis. Although more intrusive from a privacy 
          perspective, analyzing user behaviour such as scrolling patterns, mouse movements, and speed of traversal through the site would 
          provide additional information valuable for bot detection. However, these methods may also be more conducive to false-positives from 
          to accessibility devices. For example, a specialized mouse or interactive device may <i>appear</i> to be bot-generated behaviour 
          if it deviates from typical mouse movement patterns. It is crucial that website developers do not compromise on accessibility in
          favour of bot prevention.
